# Project Name

This repository provides a complete workflow for preprocessing healthcare service data (pharmacies, parapharmacies, hospitals), integrating it with population and territorial shapefiles, and then performing spatial kernel-based analyses to measure accessibility/fairness indicators (e.g., via Gini coefficients). The code is intended to support studies and policy decision-making regarding service coverage and equity in healthcare access.

## Overview

The projectâ€™s primary goal is to **evaluate healthcare services distribution** (like pharmacies, parapharmacies, hospitals) in relation to population data and **perform kernel-based spatial analyses** to derive metrics of accessibility fairness.

**Main features** include:
- Preprocessing CSV data (cleaning, geocoding missing addresses).
- Merging population and administrative boundary shapefiles.
- Applying convolution-like kernels on rasterized layers to measure service accessibility.
- Exporting aggregated statistics by region/province/municipality (CSV, XLSX).
- Computing fairness metrics such as the Gini coefficient.

## Repository Structure


- **CSV_Data_Utils.py**: Tools for CSV loading, deduplication, geocoding.  
- **Gini.py**: Classes and methods to compute Gini coefficients on kernel outputs.  
- **Kernel_Utils.py**: Functions that apply convolution kernels to raster data.  
- **Kernels.py**: Predefined kernel matrices by service type and size.  
- **SHP_Utils.py**: Helpers for GeoDataFrame handling (reprojection, merging).  
- **main.py**: Orchestrates the full workflow (preprocessing, kernel application, exports).

## Requirements and Installation

1. **Python 3.8+**  
2. **Dependencies** (install via pip or conda):
   - `geopandas`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `rasterio`, `shapely`, `geopy`, `pyproj`, `xlsxwriter`
3. **QGIS / GDAL** (recommended for rasterization).
4. **Data**: The repository expects CSVs (services, population), shapefiles (boundaries, grids), and raster layers.

## Data Description

- **services**: Raw CSVs for **pharmacies**, **parapharmacies**, **hospitals**.  
- **population**: Shapefiles (e.g., population grids), CSVs with age-based data.  
- **ImagesMap**: Raster files derived from shapefiles (via QGIS or GDAL).  
- **ImagesResults**: Output folder for kernel-convolved rasters.  
- **Results_CSV**: CSVs summarizing accessibility metrics by region/province/municipality.  
- **Results_SHP**: Shapefiles enriched with final metrics.
